Mikka has a very diverse placing history, commuting between 5th in a small tournament to 1st in a big tournament. Regardless of this he is ranked #1, much thanks to him winning the only singles tournament ever - SSEMI 2016.
\nSSE-II 2020 aroused a record amount of controversy due to unconventional decisions in both tournaments, and both affected Mikka and his teammate YMG.
Mikka and YMG dominated the beerpong tournament and came to meet Jarmo Satana (Jarmo & Abbe) in the grand final.
The tournament ended via a loophole in the rulebook regarding the amount of cups that should be retained after a rollback, which Mikka and YMG abused.
Mikka and YMG also dominated the Smash tournament, easily tearing through the bracket until the grand final. 
Where they met the already beaten (3-1) Acrid, who for this match hade switched teamate to a upper ranked player - Zeor. Those kind of pairings are normally illegal and this tournament decision might've lost Mikka the win.`,

Prior to this, the two had come to an agreement of facing off one day.

Acrid took it upon himself and practiced a whole year before attending his first Skrall Smash Event - SSE-II 2020.
\nTeaming up with Papi, they teared through the competition until the first match against Team TK (Mikka & YMG), where he once again lost and got pushed down to loser's bracket.
Demolishing the loser's bracket, Acrid got to switch teammate to Zeor mid-tournament due to a feud after the beerpong grand final, resulting in Papi and Abbe leaving the event before loser's final in Smash. 
With the help of Zeor, Acrid managed to claim the Grand final win against Mikka & YMG. 
The tournament ending aroused much controversy, as Zeor was ranked a upper-player, making the duo illegal and unpairable.
\nNext year came to be Acrids redemption and new sheet. 
At SSE-II 2020, he teamed up with Lexclusive and created an unstoppable force.
Setting a record of not losing a single game, they destroyed the competition as if there was none. With Acrids placements, he his predicted to surpass LTR and his rival Mikka.

He came as an underdog, never touched the game but quickly rose to become one of the best. 
Barre started out as a very defensive player who excelled in projectiles and spacing with characters such as Link and Lucario.

\nAt SSE-MI 2016 he was very close of beating a god (LTR) 1v1 ending the set 2-3, placing 3rd. 
SSE-LI 2017 was a down-time for Barre where he finished last, and also 5th in the unranked melee tournament. 
So, 2017 being his Link year, he as some others, swapped to main Cloud for 2018. 
After the first SSE-II event (2017) he seemed to be rising towards his previously expected potential finishing 4th. 
Sadly, the year after, he finished last once again. This leaves Barre very fluid and unpredictable.. 
His 1v1 skills are easily considered one of the best, but he may depend too much on his team combination during tournaments. 
\nBarre got a little bit of redemption at SSE-II 2021 where he teamed up with Miley and destroyed everyone in their group during group stage.

        "info": "Is one of the founders of Skrallgaming but never joined the Smash community until 2016 at SSE-MI. At this event he finished 9th, only defeating JS. The year after at SSE-LI, MC together with his teamate Anttown in B-boyz formed today's Bowser Meta. Though placing last that tournament, they made a huge impact on the meta game. MC is one of two Cpt. Falcon mains and actually manages to do combos with his special abilites which is a pleseant sight for the crowd. At SSE-II 2018 he got his best placing yet, teaming up with Eb0la defeating R and YOLOwille. Will MC surpass Habo's rating?",

He came late to SSE-MI 2016 and stalled the schedule, resulting in him playing his two games right away after his arrival. Both games were lost and went pretty fast, creating sort of a meme of JS attending, instantly losing after a few minutes, only to then be granted to leave again. After SSE-II 2017's afterparty he's rumored to be traumatized. Will we ever see JS at an SSE ever again?",
